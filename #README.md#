# Rails Testing Demo

A barebones Rails app that aims to show how to build an app with some simple unit tests.

## Why Test?
* It helps you from breaking other people's code.
* It helps you from introducing a bug as you change code. (Regressions!)
* It can make you think critically about what you're building.
